### A C++ Standard library built from scratch, with its own implementations of standard data structures and several features from the Rust language.



This project explores an alternative design for a modern C++ standard library that is more suited towards embedded systems, high performance, and memory safety. It is a work in progress, and serves more as a collection of ideas for the time being. 

* **Portability:** This is a header only library, which should work well with any build system. *While it is only guaranteed to work with the clang compiler, clang supports a large variety of architectures.*
* **Suitability for embedded systems:** No use of exceptions, heap allocation, or dynamic typing; able to run without a C++ runtime.
* **Only pay for what you use:** The only features that are compiled are the ones you use, so that smaller executables can be built.
* **Good Performance:** Performance critical code generation is checked using [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org). Also, it's simple to check codegen for yourself on Compiler Explorer by [including the library over http](docs/httpinclude.md).
* **Memory Safety:** Various features inspired by Rust are implemented, such as [tagged unions](docs/core/union.md), Result, and [Optional](docs/Option.md) types, are provided to support memory safe programming. No features will invoke undefined behavior if used incorrectly.

## Setup/Requirements

The project requires C++26 to compile. The only requirements are **clang++ (>20.0)**, **cmake**, and [**ninja**](https://ninja-build.org/).
Then, run the **setup** script and select the platform to build for.
Use the **run** script to build and run a sample.
